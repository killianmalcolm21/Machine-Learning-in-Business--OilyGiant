The project will:

Load and Explore the Data for the three regions to understand the structure, integrity, and quality of the data.

Train Linear Regression Models to predict oil reserves based on the available geological features.

Evaluate Model Accuracy using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and average predicted reserves.

Calculate Profitability for each region:
Select the top 200 wells with the highest predicted reserves.
Estimate total profit considering the budget and oil price.

Apply Bootstrapping Technique to:
Simulate profitability over multiple random samples.
Calculate average profit, 95% confidence interval, and risk of loss for each region.

Select the Best Region that meets the risk requirement:
Risk of loss must be below 2.5%.
The region should have the highest expected profit.
