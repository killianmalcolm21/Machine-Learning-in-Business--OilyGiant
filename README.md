ðŸ›¢ OilyGiant Oil Well Selection Project

ðŸ“Œ Introduction
OilyGiant is planning to expand its operations by developing new oil wells in one of three potential regions. Each region has undergone geological exploration, and data has been collected for 100,000 wells in each area. The data includes geological features and the measured oil reserves for each well.

The companyâ€™s objective is to select the single most profitable region for developing 200 new wells out of the 500 wells examined in that region. Due to the high cost and risk involved in oil extraction, a data-driven decision is critical to maximize profitability and minimize financial risk.
ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

The project will:

Load and Explore the Data for the three regions to understand the structure, integrity, and quality of the data.

Train Linear Regression Models to predict oil reserves based on the available geological features.

Evaluate Model Accuracy using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) and average predicted reserves.

Calculate Profitability for each region:
Select the top 200 wells with the highest predicted reserves.
Estimate total profit considering the budget and oil price.

Apply Boots trapping Technique to:
Simulate profitability over multiple random samples.
Calculate average profit, 95% confidence interval, and risk of loss for each region.

Select the Best Region that meets the risk requirement:
Risk of loss must be below 2.5%.
The region should have the highest expected profit.
ðŸ“Š Business Conditions
Budget: 4,500.
Region Selection Criteria: Risk of loss < 2.5%.

Highest expected profit among eligible regions.

âœ… Expected Outcome
The project will provide a clear, justified recommendation on which region (if any) OilyGiant should select for drilling operations, or advise against development if all regions present unacceptable risk.
